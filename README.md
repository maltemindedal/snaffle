# PyFetch: A Lightweight HTTP CLI and Library

A lightweight command-line interface and Python library for making HTTP requests.
Built with Python, this tool provides an easy way to make GET, POST, PUT, PATCH,
DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests with support for JSON data, customizable timeouts,
automatic retries on failures, and a verbose mode for detailed logging.

## Features

- Simple command-line interface
- Can be used as a Python library
- Case-insensitive commands (GET/get, POST/post etc.)
- Support for GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests
- JSON data handling for POST requests
- Optional progress bars for large file downloads (>5MB)
- Customizable timeout settings and automatic retries on failures
- Connection pooling: repeated requests to a host reuse the TCP/TLS connection
- Fast start-up: the HTTP stack is imported only when a request is actually made
- Verbose mode for debugging: logs requests and responses
- Detailed response output
  - Status code
  - Response headers
  - Response body (pretty-printed if JSON)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Built-in help system

## Performance

The client keeps a pooled `requests.Session` alive for its lifetime, so a second
request to the same host skips the TCP and TLS handshake entirely. Measured
against `https://example.com` (median of 6 requests) and a local server:

| Scenario                                | Before  | After   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Repeat HTTPS request to the same host   | 24.5 ms | 6.2 ms  |
| 100 sequential local GETs (per request) | 1.47 ms | 0.57 ms |
| TCP connections opened per 200 requests | 200     | 1       |
| Request returning a 404                 | 4.78 ms | 0.60 ms |
| CLI start-up (`pyfetch HELP`)           | 238 ms  | 80 ms   |

Behaviours that changed to get there:

- **Retries are now selective.** Only connection failures and transient statuses
  (408, 425, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504) are retried. Previously every failure was
  retried three times, so a 404 cost three round trips to reach the same answer.
- **`GET` no longer streams unless `--progress` is used.** Streaming a body that
  nothing consumes held a connection open per request. A caller who passes
  `stream=True` explicitly still gets an unconsumed response to iterate.
- **A client now owns a connection and should be closed.** Use it as a context
  manager or call `close()`. Code that created a client per request will hold
  sockets open until garbage collection.
- **`DOWNLOAD_CHUNK_SIZE` rose from 8 KiB to 64 KiB**, which affects the working
  set while a `--progress` download is in flight.

### What is and isn't retried

urllib3 applies its idempotent-method filter to read errors and to retryable
statuses, but **not** to connection errors. That asymmetry is deliberate, and
PyFetch keeps it:

| Failure                              | `GET`, `HEAD`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS` | `POST`, `PATCH` |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Connection never established         | retried                                   | **retried**     |
| Read failure after the request landed| retried                                   | not retried     |
| Retryable status (429, 503, ...)     | retried                                   | not retried     |

A request that never reached the server cannot have been acted on twice, so
retrying it is safe for any method. Once the request is on the wire, a `POST`
may already have been processed, so it is never replayed.

Retries use exponential backoff and honour `Retry-After`. The trade-off is that
a request destined to fail takes about half a second longer across the default
three attempts than an immediate-retry loop would.

### Optional transfer compression

Installing the `speedups` extra lets urllib3 negotiate Zstandard and Brotli, so
large text and JSON responses arrive materially smaller:

```bash
uv sync --extra speedups
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) _(recommended)_

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maltemindedal/PyFetch.git
cd PyFetch
```

2. Sync the project dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --group dev
```

3. Run the CLI from the managed environment:

```bash
uv run pyfetch HELP
```

## Library Usage

You can also use PyFetch as a library in your Python projects.

### Creating a Client

First, import and create an instance of the `HTTPClient`:

```python
from PyFetch import HTTPClient

client = HTTPClient(timeout=30, retries=3, verbose=False)
```

Each client owns a pooled connection. Use it as a context manager (or call
`client.close()`) so the pool is released when you are done, and keep one client
for a batch of requests rather than creating one per call:

```python
with HTTPClient() as client:
    for page in range(10):
        # Every iteration after the first reuses the open connection.
        client.get(f"https://httpbin.org/get?page={page}")
```

### Making Requests

You can then use the client to make HTTP requests:

```python
# Make a GET request
response = client.get("https://httpbin.org/get")
print(response.json())

# Make a POST request with JSON data
data = {"key": "value"}
response = client.post("https://httpbin.org/post", json=data)
print(response.json())
```

### Error Handling

The client raises specific exceptions for different types of errors:

```python
from PyFetch.exceptions import HTTPClientError, HTTPConnectionError

try:
    response = client.get("https://a-non-existent-domain.com")
except HTTPConnectionError as e:
    print(f"Connection failed: {e}")
except HTTPClientError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## CLI Usage

### Example Commands

```bash
# 1. Normal GET request:
pyfetch GET https://httpbin.org/get

# 2. GET request with progress bar (for files larger than 5MB):
pyfetch GET https://example.com/large-file.zip --progress

# 3. GET request with verbose mode to see retry logs and detailed output:
pyfetch GET https://httpbin.org/get --verbose

# 4. GET request with a custom header (e.g., Authorization token):
pyfetch GET https://httpbin.org/headers -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here"

# 5. POST request with JSON data and custom Content-Type header:
pyfetch POST https://httpbin.org/post -d '{"key": "value"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# 6. PUT request example to update a resource:
pyfetch PUT https://httpbin.org/put -d '{"name": "New Name"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# 7. PATCH request example to partially update a resource:
pyfetch PATCH https://httpbin.org/patch -d '{"email": "user@example.com"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# 8. DELETE request to remove a resource:
pyfetch DELETE https://httpbin.org/delete

# 9. HEAD request to fetch only headers:
pyfetch HEAD https://httpbin.org/get

# 10. OPTIONS request to check allowed methods:
pyfetch OPTIONS https://httpbin.org/get

# 11. Show help message:
pyfetch HELP
```

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite using Python's unittest framework.

### Running Tests

Run all tests using the UV-managed environment:

```bash
uv run python -m unittest discover tests
```

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
```

### Type Checking

```bash
uv run mypy .
```

To apply the formatter locally:

```bash
uv run ruff format .
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

- HTTP client functionality
- CLI commands and arguments
- Error handling and exceptions
- Input validation
- Response processing

### Writing Tests

Tests are organized in three main files:

- `tests/test_cli.py` - Command-line interface tests
- `tests/test_http_client.py` - HTTP client functionality tests
- `tests/test_exceptions.py` - Exception handling tests

Typing is enforced with `mypy` in strict mode across both `PyFetch/` and `tests/`.

To add new tests:

1. Choose the appropriate test file based on functionality
2. Create a new test method in the relevant test class
3. Use unittest assertions to verify behavior
4. Run the test suite to ensure all tests pass
